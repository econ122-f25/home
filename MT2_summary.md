## Areas for Improvement

**Question 5 - K-Nearest Neighbors** (Average: 66.9%)
- **Lowest performing question** on the exam
- **Part b (K Tradeoffs & Selection)** was the weakest area (55% average):
  - Students struggled explaining **how to choose K** (cross-validation)
  - Many **reversed bias-variance relationship** (incorrectly stating low K has high bias)
  - Only 1 student earned full credit on this part
- Part c (When K-NN works well/poorly) also challenging (69% average)

**Question 2 - Regression with Interaction Terms** (Average: 67.4%)
- Students struggled with **interaction terms** in regression equations
- Difficulty combining coefficients and substituting indicator variables

**Question 1 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff** (Average: 85.0%)
- Despite good overall performance, 5 students (19%) **reversed bias-variance relationship**
- Incorrectly stated that bias increases with flexibility (or variance decreases)
